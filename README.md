# ECE228-Flower-Classification
This is a course project for ECE228(Machine Learn for Phys Applic - Gerstoft )

We use two method to classify flowers, one is SVM, the other is CNN(VGG series)

In CNN part, we use three VGG: VGG 11, VGG 13 and VGG 16, comparing efffect from depth of CNN. Then we use different learning rate(0.001, 0.005, 0.01 and 0.05) in train stage using VGG 16 to figure out the influence of learning rates.
